# How to Plan Your Wizard's Vault Session

**Goal**: Plan your daily Wizard's Vault session efficiently by checking objectives, rewards, and your Astral Acclaim balance before you play.

## Prerequisites

- GW2 MCP Server running and connected to your AI assistant -- see [Getting Started](../tutorials/getting-started/)
- A GW2 API key with **account** and **progression** scopes for personal progress tracking -- see [API Scopes](../reference/api-scopes/)
- Without an API key, you can still view objective lists and reward catalogs, but you will not see your completion status or purchase history

## Steps

### 1. Check your daily objectives

> Ask your AI: "What are today's Wizard's Vault dailies?"

Your assistant retrieves your daily objectives and shows each one with its Astral Acclaim reward value. With an API key configured, you also see which objectives you have already completed and your progress on partially finished ones. Without an API key, you see the objective list without any personal tracking.

### 2. Check your weekly objectives

> Ask your AI: "What about the weeklies?"

Your assistant retrieves your weekly objectives the same way. Weekly objectives reset on Monday and are typically worth more Astral Acclaim than dailies. Look for weeklies that overlap with your daily objectives -- completing both at the same time is the most efficient approach.

### 3. Check available rewards

> Ask your AI: "What can I buy from the Wizard's Vault?"

Your assistant shows the full Wizard's Vault reward catalog with Astral Acclaim prices. With an API key, the response also indicates which items you have already purchased this season and how many times (some rewards are repeatable).

### 4. Check your Astral Acclaim balance

> Ask your AI: "How much Astral Acclaim do I have?"

Your assistant retrieves your current Wizard's Vault season information, including your Astral Acclaim balance and the season timeline. This tells you how much currency you have to spend and how much time remains in the current season.

### 5. Plan your session

Now that you have the full picture, pick the dailies and weeklies that overlap with what you are already planning to do. For example, if a daily objective is "Complete a meta event" and a weekly objective is "Complete 5 meta events," running meta events knocks out both at once.

**Tip:** The Wizard's Vault objectives change daily and weekly. Check at the start of each play session to maximize your Astral Acclaim earning. Building this into a habit ensures you never miss easy objectives that align with content you were going to do anyway.
